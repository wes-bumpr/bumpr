# The BUMPR Project is a website development project for Wellesley students to efficiently find other students to carpool with to a certain destination. It acts as a scheduler that uses the matching algorithm to schedule two or more students together. 
# Backend Language: Python
# Database: Firebase
# Goal: Create a matching algorithm that will consider certain parameters to choose a group of people to carpool to their destination. The parameters include the distance, time at which students request/need to reach a destination, the price of the trip, the starting location & destination.
